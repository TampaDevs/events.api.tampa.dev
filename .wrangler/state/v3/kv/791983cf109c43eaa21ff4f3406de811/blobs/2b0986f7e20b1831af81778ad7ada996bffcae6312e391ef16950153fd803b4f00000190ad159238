Payment information is below. **Please note: this is *not* the tool signoff for 3D printing at Tampa Hackerspace. Effective April 2024, this class focuses on PrusaSlicer, rather than Cura.** While Cura offers the broadest printer support for Hackerspace members and nonmembers alike, the audience has shifted since the pandemic to more people looking to use the Prusa machines we have onsite.\n\nThis is a hands-on, online class for anyone who is brand new to 3D printing and wants to get up and running with choosing models and getting them ready to print. We recommend that you join this class from a computer you will be using to prepare models for printing, especially if you are a member of Tampa Hackerspace and plan to use the machines at our site. This class does involve installing software on your computer and following along with the instructor; however, there is no final project, and you are free to listen and take notes instead.\n\nWe’ll take a look at a few sources for models that you may want to print, and we’ll look at how to tell what kinds of modifications your model might need to print successfully. We’ll walk through setting up PrusaSlicer, an interface that will convert the digital images of your model into toolpaths for the printer to make your model into a physical object. Finally, we’ll take a model from .STL to GCode to show you the full process of getting a print ready for production. Once we’re done, we can cover some questions and answers you may have about 3D printing and, if applicable, joining Tampa Hackerspace.\n\nIf you do not already have PrusaSlicer installed, you can download it directly from Prusa (for free!) at [https://www.prusa3d.com/en/page/prusaslicer_424/](https://www.prusa3d.com/en/page/prusaslicer_424/) . We won’t spend much time on the install during class, so you can save yourself some time if you download and install before we meet. I will be in the class a bit early in case you have any questions about downloading and installing the software. (Note that PrusaSlicer runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux.)\n\nMembers no charge (unless you no-show!); non-members $5\n\nThe member price is for paid members of Tampa Hackerspace. Information on becoming a paid member can be found on our website (http://tampahackerspace.com/membership). You can prepay for the class at our Square Marketplace (https://tampahackerspace.square.site/product/3d-printing-non-members-/4?cs=true).\n\n***\n\nPayment is expected within 24 hours of your RSVP. If anyone hasn't paid by then, they may shifted to the wait list to make room for other students.\n\n***\n\nIf you've been moved to the waiting list, we couldn't match a payment through Square for the class to your meetup account or verify your membership. If this is in error, please message info@tampahackerspace.com. If you haven't yet paid, please do so at the link above and we'll move you back to the active list.",

The Vaadin platform flips that idea on it's head and offers solutions built around Java, a backend language.\nIn this session featuring live-coded examples, we'll dive into how Vaadin's web frameworks, Flow and Hilla, can help developers build feature-rich web apps. We'll explore how these frameworks put the power in Java developer's hands by either building web apps purely in Java, or by combining Spring Boot and React in a single full-stack project. We'll show how to use Vaadin's web components as the building blocks to build awesome UIs.",

We'll dissect the process of combining macro and microeconomic data sets with market trends and geospatial information. This process utilizes similarity scoring - a technique to analyze the distance between geographic regions and uncover hidden correlations. Additionally, we'll tackle the exciting challenge of classifying emerging neighborhoods using AI. Imagine leveraging machine learning to pinpoint areas with a high concentration of rehabbed properties - a strong indicator of potential investment opportunities.\n\nWe will also cover the data orchestration of the project, using AWS & CircleCI for daily runs of data transformations amongst different sources.",

We hoard as much of it as we can with the goals to make sense of it and extract value. But delivering on that promise isn't so simple. If data science is where the data is analyzed, data engineering is how it gets there.\n\nJoin Rich Winslow, CTO at Tetricus Labs, and a data engineer/scientist with 20 years of experience handling and managing data, to learn how to approach data engineering problems practically and ask the right questions. You'll also hear his personal anecdotes that drive home what can go right and wrong when deploying your own solutions.\n\n**Who should attend**: Anyone who works with data and wants to get a better understanding of how to create value from raw information.\n\n**Why attend**: There are many tools, books, and resources out there on solutions to data engineering problems, but few to no resources on *how* to think about and approach those problems. This will give you a foundation to start from so you ask the right questions and look for the right solutions.",
