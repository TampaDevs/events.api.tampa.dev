In this session, you’ll learn how to identify common accessibility pitfalls and implement practical strategies to overcome them. Discover tools like axe DevTools and eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y, explore best practices for keyboard navigation, focus management, and ARIA roles, and see how accessible component libraries can simplify your work. By the end, you’ll have insights to build web apps that are not only functional but truly accessible, so everyone can enjoy!",

While we obviously always need new speakers, it's clear that having several hosts for venues, and sponsors for refreshments, would help lighten the load on our regular contributors.\n\nMessage Mike T (de facto organizer) if you would like to present a data science related talk to our community. My personal favorites are talks presenting real life applications, whether professional or hobbist, but all data sciency (scienceish?) talks are welcome.\n\nFurther, if your place of work has space for 30 - 40 polite and respectful data scientists, let us know. I often refer to the Tampa Bay area as a \"Doughnut Metropolis.\" Barring a big enough boat for us to assemble in the doughnut hole, locations scattered around the bay area would increase accessibility and alleviate gephyrophobia.\n\nFinally, we want to keep these events free and open. One or two hundred bucks for food and drinks may not sound like much, but it adds up over time and we don't want to take any contributors for granted. So if you or a business or institution you know might be willing to pony up for one of our meetings, please get in touch. Of course, we can show our appreciation in various ways.\n\nIf you have any ideas or interest, send me a message now!\n\nRespectfully,\nMike T.",

While we obviously always need new speakers, it's clear that having several hosts for venues, and sponsors for refreshments, would help lighten the load on our regular contributors.\n\nMessage Mike T (de facto organizer) if you would like to present a data science related talk to our community. My personal favorites are talks presenting real life applications, whether professional or hobbist, but all data sciency (scienceish?) talks are welcome.\n\nFurther, if your place of work has space for 30 - 40 polite and respectful data scientists, let us know. I often refer to the Tampa Bay area as a \"Doughnut Metropolis.\" Barring a big enough boat for us to assemble in the doughnut hole, locations scattered around the bay area would increase accessibility and alleviate gephyrophobia.\n\nFinally, we want to keep these events free and open. One or two hundred bucks for food and drinks may not sound like much, but it adds up over time and we don't want to take any contributors for granted. So if you or a business or institution you know might be willing to pony up for one of our meetings, please get in touch. Of course, we can show our appreciation in various ways.\n\nIf you have any ideas or interest, send me a message now!\n\nRespectfully,\nMike T.",

This is the first in a series of workshops focused on giving you the basics for programming simple and useful solutions with Python.\n\nLearners should bring their own computers:\n\n* For PCs with Windows, it would be best to have Windows 11 with WSL2 installed.\n* For Mac and Linux, you should have what you need to get started.\n\nIf you have no idea about what any of the things above are, that's okay: the first session will be an orientation to the language, getting setup, and making your first program.\n\n**Schedule for Workshop 1**\n\n\\* Introduction to Python\n\\* Getting Setup\n\\* Writing Your First Program\n\\* Homework Assignment\n\nYour homework assignment will be to pick a topic area you're interested in (be it from work, school, or other) and think of a use case where Python could help automate a task. Try to keep it simple: pick a task where you are automating just one thing and bring a write-up to the next workshop.",
