We hoard as much of it as we can with the goals to make sense of it and extract value. But delivering on that promise isn't so simple. If data science is where the data is analyzed, data engineering is how it gets there.\n\nJoin Rich Winslow, CTO at Tetricus Labs, and a data engineer/scientist with 20 years of experience handling and managing data, to learn how to approach data engineering problems practically and ask the right questions. You'll also hear his personal anecdotes that drive home what can go right and wrong when deploying your own solutions.\n\n**Who should attend**: Anyone who works with data and wants to get a better understanding of how to create value from raw information.\n\n**Why attend**: There are many tools, books, and resources out there on solutions to data engineering problems, but few to no resources on *how* to think about and approach those problems. This will give you a foundation to start from so you ask the right questions and look for the right solutions.",

While we obviously always need new speakers, it's clear that having several hosts for venues, and sponsors for refreshments, would help lighten the load on our regular contributors.\n\nMessage Mike T (de facto organizer) if you would like to present a data science related talk to our community. My personal favorites are talks presenting real life applications, whether professional or hobbist, but all data sciency (scienceish?) talks are welcome.\n\nFurther, if your place of work has space for 30 - 40 polite and respectful data scientists, let us know. I often refer to the Tampa Bay area as a \"Doughnut Metropolis.\" Barring a big enough boat for us to assemble in the doughnut hole, locations scattered around the bay area would increase accessibility and alleviate gephyrophobia.\n\nFinally, we want to keep these events free and open. One or two hundred bucks for food and drinks may not sound like much, but it adds up over time and we don't want to take any contributors for granted. So if you or a business or institution you know might be willing to pony up for one of our meetings, please get in touch. Of course, we can show our appreciation in various ways.\n\nIf you have any ideas or interest, send me a message now!\n\nRespectfully,\nMike T.",

While we obviously always need new speakers, it's clear that having several hosts for venues, and sponsors for refreshments, would help lighten the load on our regular contributors.\n\nMessage Mike T (de facto organizer) if you would like to present a data science related talk to our community. My personal favorites are talks presenting real life applications, whether professional or hobbist, but all data sciency (scienceish?) talks are welcome.\n\nFurther, if your place of work has space for 30 - 40 polite and respectful data scientists, let us know. I often refer to the Tampa Bay area as a \"Doughnut Metropolis.\" Barring a big enough boat for us to assemble in the doughnut hole, locations scattered around the bay area would increase accessibility and alleviate gephyrophobia.\n\nFinally, we want to keep these events free and open. One or two hundred bucks for food and drinks may not sound like much, but it adds up over time and we don't want to take any contributors for granted. So if you or a business or institution you know might be willing to pony up for one of our meetings, please get in touch. Of course, we can show our appreciation in various ways.\n\nIf you have any ideas or interest, send me a message now!\n\nRespectfully,\nMike T.",

While we obviously always need new speakers, it's clear that having several hosts for venues, and sponsors for refreshments, would help lighten the load on our regular contributors.\n\nMessage Mike T (de facto organizer) if you would like to present a data science related talk to our community. My personal favorites are talks presenting real life applications, whether professional or hobbist, but all data sciency (scienceish?) talks are welcome.\n\nFurther, if your place of work has space for 30 - 40 polite and respectful data scientists, let us know. I often refer to the Tampa Bay area as a \"Doughnut Metropolis.\" Barring a big enough boat for us to assemble in the doughnut hole, locations scattered around the bay area would increase accessibility and alleviate gephyrophobia.\n\nFinally, we want to keep these events free and open. One or two hundred bucks for food and drinks may not sound like much, but it adds up over time and we don't want to take any contributors for granted. So if you or a business or institution you know might be willing to pony up for one of our meetings, please get in touch. Of course, we can show our appreciation in various ways.\n\nIf you have any ideas or interest, send me a message now!\n\nRespectfully,\nMike T.",

The Vaadin platform flips that idea on it's head and offers solutions built around Java, a backend language.\nIn this session featuring live-coded examples, we'll dive into how Vaadin's web frameworks, Flow and Hilla, can help developers build feature-rich web apps. We'll explore how these frameworks put the power in Java developer's hands by either building web apps purely in Java, or by combining Spring Boot and React in a single full-stack project. We'll show how to use Vaadin's web components as the building blocks to build awesome UIs.",

In order to succeed in that spirit to keep up with change, we need to bring in several sustainable practices. Without proper discipline and rigor the efforts for continuous deliver can soon turn into a nightmare for teams and organizations that rely on them. In this presentation we will discuss a dozen practices, why we need to focus on each one of them, and how they impact the ability to keep pace with continuous delivery.\n\n**Dr. Venkat Subramaniam** is an award-winning author, founder of Agile Developer, Inc., an instructional professor at the University of Houston, and the creator of the dev2next conference.\n\nHe has trained and mentored thousands of software developers in the US, Canada, Europe, and Asia, and is a regularly-invited speaker at several international conferences.

                        "description": "This class is offered online. It is open to everyone. $5 fee for non-members. Payment information is below. **Please note: this is *not* the tool signoff for 3D printing at Tampa Hackerspace. Effective April 2024, this class focuses on PrusaSlicer, rather than Cura.** While Cura offers the broadest printer support for Hackerspace members and nonmembers alike, the audience has shifted since the pandemic to more people looking to use the Prusa machines we have onsite.\n\nThis is a hands-on, online class for anyone who is brand new to 3D printing and wants to get up and running with choosing models and getting them ready to print. We recommend that you join this class from a computer you will be using to prepare models for printing, especially if you are a member of Tampa Hackerspace and plan to use the machines at our site. This class does involve installing software on your computer and following along with the instructor; however, there is no final project, and you are free to listen and take notes instead.\n\nWe\u2019ll take a look at a few sources for models that you may want to print, and we\u2019ll look at how to tell what kinds of modifications your model might need to print successfully. We\u2019ll walk through setting up PrusaSlicer, an interface that will convert the digital images of your model into toolpaths for the printer to make your model into a physical object. Finally, we\u2019ll take a model from .STL to GCode to show you the full process of getting a print ready for production. Once we\u2019re done, we can cover some questions and answers you may have about 3D printing and, if applicable, joining Tampa Hackerspace.\n\nIf you do not already have PrusaSlicer installed, you can download it directly from Prusa (for free!) at [https://www.prusa3d.com/en/page/prusaslicer_424/](https://www.prusa3d.com/en/page/prusaslicer_424/) . We won\u2019t spend much time on the install during class, so you can save yourself some time if you download and install before we meet. I will be in the class a bit early in case you have any questions about downloading and installing the software. (Note that PrusaSlicer runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux.)\n\nMembers no charge (unless you no-show!); non-members $5\n\nThe member price is for paid members of Tampa Hackerspace. Information on becoming a paid member can be found on our website (http://tampahackerspace.com/membership). You can prepay for the class at our Square Marketplace (https://tampahackerspace.square.site/product/3d-printing-non-members-/4?cs=true).\n\n***\n\nPayment is expected within 24 hours of your RSVP. If anyone hasn't paid by then, they may shifted to the wait list to make room for other students.\n\n***\n\nIf you've been moved to the waiting list, we couldn't match a payment through Square for the class to your meetup account or verify your membership.

This meetup is free of charge and open to all.\n\n(Yes, this includes you, knitters, crocheters, cross-stitchers, embroiderers, weavers, tie-dyers, and anyone else who works with fabric, thread, yarn, etc.)\n\nThink of this as an \"Open Make\" event -- bring your project, or just come to learn & see what others are working on. We're working on putting together classes and/or group projects for future meetups.\n\nTampa Hackerspace is in the midst of expanding, and we now have a dedicated sewing & textiles area! Come on out!\n\nWe have a few working sewing machines set up, including a serger, and a large cutting table. If you have a project to work on, you may want to bring a machine if you're able as we may have more stitchers than sewing machines.",

                        "description": "**OOUX & ORCA: Untangling Complexity in Your Design Process**\nNavigating the complexities of product development can be daunting, especially when teams need a complete picture. **This session explores the ORCA method, an object-oriented approach that bridges the gaps left between research and design by traditional frameworks. Attendees will dive into real product scenarios, discovering how OOUX and ORCA can be applied from different angles.** By understanding system pieces and relationships, teams can improve planning, enhance data strategies, and be confident with designs that align with user thinking. Attendees will learn the principles of Object-Oriented UX (OOUX) and how ORCA fosters a shared understanding, leading to intuitive solutions and efficient development processes. This approach ensures seamless collaboration among product managers, designers, data analysts, researchers, content designers, and engineers, resulting in intuitive solutions and efficient development processes.\n\n**About the Speaker**\n[Gabriela Ospina](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gospina/) is a dynamic product design leader and strategist with a decade-plus track record.
