Every product owner has been salivating at the possibility of new AI-powered features. Every marketing department is chomping at the bit to add a ‚Äúpowered by AI‚Äù sticker to the website. For the average layperson playing with ChatGPT‚Äôs conversational interface, it seems easy.\n\nHowever, integrating these tools securely, reliably, and in a cost-effective manner requires much more than just adding a chat interface. Getting consistent results from a chat interface is more than an art than a science. Ultimately, the chat interface is a nice gimmick to show off capabilities, but serious integration of these tools into most applications requires a more thoughtful approach.\n\nThat‚Äôs what this presentaion is all about! This isn‚Äôt another ‚ÄúAI is Magic‚Äù cheerleading session, nor is it an overly critical analysis of the field. Instead, this session looks at a number of valid use cases for the tools and introduces architecture patterns for implementing these use cases. We‚Äôll explore the tradeoffs of the patterns as well as the application of AI in each scenario. We'll explore usecases from simple, direct integrations to the more complex involving RAG and agentic systems.\n\nAlthough this is an emerging field, the content is not theoretical. These are patterns that are being used in production both in Michael's practice as a hands-on software architect and beyond. Architects must maintain their breadth, and this session will build on that to prepare you for the inevitable AI-powered project in your future.\n\n**NOTE**: Please arrive before 6:30 the latest as doors will close and we won't be able to get you.\n\n**Parking:** Please park in any **unmarked** spot on the 3rd floor of the Waterview garage so you can take the skybridge. Take the elevator and KForce is on the 5th floor.\n\n**Agenda**\n5:30 - 6:15: Networking w/ food and refreshments\n6:15 - 7:30: Intros and Technical Talk\n7:30 - 8:00: End w/ raffle, cleanup and go to Colony Grill to continue the conversation\n\n**Thanks to our sponsors!**\nVenue Sponsor: **KForce**\nFood Sponsor: **Couchbase**",

While we obviously always need new speakers, it's clear that having several hosts for venues, and sponsors for refreshments, would help lighten the load on our regular contributors.\n\nMessage Mike T (de facto organizer) if you would like to present a data science related talk to our community. My personal favorites are talks presenting real life applications, whether professional or hobbist, but all data sciency (scienceish?) talks are welcome.\n\nFurther, if your place of work has space for 30 - 40 polite and respectful data scientists, let us know. I often refer to the Tampa Bay area as a \"Doughnut Metropolis.\" Barring a big enough boat for us to assemble in the doughnut hole, locations scattered around the bay area would increase accessibility and alleviate gephyrophobia.\n\nFinally, we want to keep these events free and open. One or two hundred bucks for food and drinks may not sound like much, but it adds up over time and we don't want to take any contributors for granted. So if you or a business or institution you know might be willing to pony up for one of our meetings, please get in touch.

It covers the basics of preparing raster and vector images for use with the laser, operating the laser safely, and basic procedures. We will also cover what materials the laser is capable of cutting and etching and which materials must be avoided. We'll also demonstrate the air assist and rotary table.\n\\*\\*Plan to arrive 10 minutes early to get settled and signed in. The class will start on time.\n\nThis class is free to paid members of Tampa Hackerspace.

Payment information is below. **Please note: this is *not* the tool signoff for 3D printing at Tampa Hackerspace. Effective April 2024, this class focuses on PrusaSlicer, rather than Cura.** While Cura offers the broadest printer support for Hackerspace members and nonmembers alike, the audience has shifted since the pandemic to more people looking to use the Prusa machines we have onsite.\n\nThis is a hands-on, online class for anyone who is brand new to 3D printing and wants to get up and running with choosing models and getting them ready to print. We recommend that you join this class from a computer you will be using to prepare models for printing, especially if you are a member of Tampa Hackerspace and plan to use the machines at our site. This class does involve installing software on your computer and following along with the instructor; however, there is no final project, and you are free to listen and take notes instead.\n\nWe‚Äôll take a look at a few sources for models that you may want to print, and we‚Äôll look at how to tell what kinds of modifications your model might need to print successfully. We‚Äôll walk through setting up PrusaSlicer, an interface that will convert the digital images of your model into toolpaths for the printer to make your model into a physical object. Finally, we‚Äôll take a model from .STL to GCode to show you the full process of getting a print ready for production. Once we‚Äôre done, we can cover some questions and answers you may have about 3D printing and, if applicable, joining Tampa Hackerspace.\n\nIf you do not already have PrusaSlicer installed, you can download it directly from Prusa (for free!) at [https://www.prusa3d.com/en/page/prusaslicer_424/](https://www.prusa3d.com/en/page/prusaslicer_424/) . We won‚Äôt spend much time on the install during class, so you can save yourself some time if you download and install before we meet. I will be in the class a bit early in case you have any questions about downloading and installing the software. (Note that PrusaSlicer runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux.)\n\nMembers no charge (unless you no-show!); non-members $5\n\nThe member price is for paid members of Tampa Hackerspace. Information on becoming a paid member can be found on our website (http://tampahackerspace.com/membership). You can prepay for the class at our Square Marketplace (https://tampahackerspace.square.site/product/3d-printing-non-members-/4?cs=true).\n\n***\n\nPayment is expected within 24 hours of your RSVP. If anyone hasn't paid by then, they may shifted to the wait list to make room for other students.\n\n***\n\nIf you've been moved to the waiting list, we couldn't match a payment through Square for the class to your meetup account or verify your membership. If this is in error, please message info@tampahackerspace.com. If you haven't yet paid, please do so at the link above and we'll move you back to the active list.",

She enjoys crafts like sewing, knitting, crocheting, and more. Mackenna made her first quilt in high school and will happily geek out about quilting with you any time.\n\n**Goal:** Make a quilted patchwork potholder to learn the basics of quilting.\n\n**Final Product:** 6‚Äù square, quilted, potholder in the Railfence pattern.\n\n**Total Class Time:** 3 hours\n\n**Prior Experience:** Ideally, you should have some experience with a sewing machine and be able to sew a straight line. Otherwise, this is a beginner-friendly class!\n\n**Agenda:**\n\n* **Part 1:** What is Quilting? (\\~20 minutes)\n* In this part, I‚Äôm going to talk to you about quilting. Do you need to know most of this to quilt? No. But I am teaching this class, and I am a nerd about quilting and historical quilts. So I‚Äôm going to tell you some stuff before we start. We‚Äôll also go over the quilting steps and the patterns we‚Äôll be using. You know, the stuff you actually need to know.\n\n* **Part 2:** Cutting (\\~20 minutes)\n* We will learn how to cut material, and then everyone will cut a couple of squares. We will not be cutting out all the pieces for all the potholders, since that will take too long. Instead, we‚Äôll cut some squares and *\\*pull magically pre-cooked pieces out of the oven\\**.\n\n* **Part 3:** Patchworking (\\~45 minutes)\n* We‚Äôre gonna break out the sewing machines and make our patchwork quilt blocks with the Railfence pattern. We‚Äôll practice sewing ¬º‚Äù seams and techniques like strip piecing and nesting seams.\n\n* **\\~\\~\\~ Break \\~\\~\\~** (15 minutes)\n\n* **Part 4:** Quilting (\\~30 minutes)\n* In this part, you‚Äôll turn your quilt block into a potholder. We‚Äôll create a ‚Äúquilt sandwich‚Äù, layering the face, batting, and a backing. Next, we‚Äôll trace our quilting pattern onto the face using a water-soluble pencil or chalk. Last, we‚Äôll use machine quilting to sew through all layers of the quilt sandwich, quilting them together.\n\n* **Part 5:** Binding (\\~45 minutes)\n* To finish up our potholders, we will add binding around the edges.",

Come on out!\n\nWe have a few working sewing machines set up, including a serger, and a large cutting table.

Take the elevator and KForce is on the 5th floor.\n\n**Agenda**\n5:30 - 6:15: Networking w/ food and refreshments\n6:15 - 7:30: Intros and Technical Talk\n7:30 - 8:00: End w/ raffle, cleanup and go to Colony Grill to continue the conversation\n\n**Abstract**\nSince ChatGPT rocketed the potential of generative AI into the collective consciousness there has been a race to add AI to *everything*. Every product owner has been salivating at the possibility of new AIPowered features. Every marketing department is chomping at the bit to add a ‚Äúpowered by AI‚Äù sticker to the website. For the average layperson playing with ChatGPT's conversational interface, it seems easy however integrating these tools securely, reliably, and in a costeffective manner requires much more than simply adding a chat interface. Moreover, getting consistent results from a chat interface is more than an art than a science. Ultimately, the chat interface is a nice gimmick to show off capabilities, but serious integration of these tools into most applications requires a more thoughtful approach.\n\nThis is not another ‚ÄúAI is Magic‚Äù cheerleading session, nor an overly critical analysis of the field. Instead, this session looks at a number of valid usecases for the tools and introduces architecture patterns for implementing these usecases. Throughout we will explore the tradeoffs of the patterns as well as the application of AI in each scenario. We'll explore usecases from simple, direct integrations to the more complex involving RAG and agentic systems.\n\nAlthough this is an emerging field, the content is not theoretical. These are patterns that are being used in production both in Michael's practice as a handson software architect and beyond.\n\nArchitects must maintain their breadth, and this session will build on that to prepare you for the inevitable AIpowered project in your future.\n\nVenue Sponsor: **KForce**\nFood Sponsor: **Couchbase**",
