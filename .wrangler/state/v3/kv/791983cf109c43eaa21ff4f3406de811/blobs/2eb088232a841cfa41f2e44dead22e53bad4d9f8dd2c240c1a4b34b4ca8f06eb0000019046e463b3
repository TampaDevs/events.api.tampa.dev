The Vaadin platform flips that idea on it's head and offers solutions built around Java, a backend language.\nIn this session featuring live-coded examples, we'll dive into how Vaadin's web frameworks, Flow and Hilla, can help developers build feature-rich web apps. We'll explore how these frameworks put the power in Java developer's hands by either building web apps purely in Java, or by combining Spring Boot and React in a single full-stack project. We'll show how to use Vaadin's web components as the building blocks to build awesome UIs.",

                        "description": "Join AJ Hawley for a virtual introduction and crash course of Power Automate, an automation tool that enables users to create workflows to streamline repetitive tasks and processes. It is designed with a low-code, user-friendly interface that allows anyone, regardless of technical expertise, to automate processes and improve efficiency within their organization!\n\nNonprofits/attendees will get an overview of the tool, as well as the many benefits Power Automate provides, including:\n\n1. Considerable time savings\n2. Reduced error/more accurate information\n3. Cost savings, as it helps consolidate expenses by allowing creation of custom solutions tailored to specific needs\n4. Potential reduction in the need for other software/systems\n5. Efficiency, as it integrates seamlessly with other Microsoft tools like Excel and Sharepoint\n\n**Presenter Bio:** AJ Hawley began his career in IT as a software developer. However, he quickly moved into business analysis before anyone could deploy his code. Following that, he has spent the last 10 years consulting in and building solutions on the Microsoft Power Platform. In 2021 he founded his own independent consulting business where, since its launch, he has won employee of the month every month consecutively while simultaneously disappointing his boss every day. When he’s not at his computer providing clients with innovative tech solutions, you can find him at his computer helping nonprofit organizations automate their business processes or at his computer co-hosting the live web-show Analysts After Dark. In fact, there have actually been more documented sightings of Sasquatch than recorded occurrences of AJ outside. Ignoring the occasional client visit or conference, he ironically resides in the sunshine state…you know, for the weather.",

This meetup is free of charge and open to all.\n\n(Yes, this includes you, knitters, crocheters, cross-stitchers, embroiderers, weavers, tie-dyers, and anyone else who works with fabric, thread, yarn, etc.)\n\nThink of this as an \"Open Make\" event -- bring your project, or just come to learn & see what others are working on. We're working on putting together classes and/or group projects for future meetups.\n\nTampa Hackerspace is in the midst of expanding, and we now have a dedicated sewing & textiles area! Come on out!\n\nWe have a few working sewing machines set up, including a serger, and a large cutting table. If you have a project to work on, you may want to bring a machine if you're able as we may have more stitchers than sewing machines.",
